## What is Zircle UI?

Zircle UI is a lightweight front-end library for developing zoomable user interfaces. It mixes two principles: **circular shapes** and **zooming navigation** in the aim of strengthening each other and create a good user experience. It is an Open Source project based on Vue.js. 

## Features
- **Zoomable navigation:** Enjoy a different User Experience to navigate your app. Zircle has 6 levels of depth to organize the content.
- **Circular UI:** Zircle comes with a minimal set of circular UI components to build your app. It is possible to customize themes and styles to fit your needs.
- **Responsive:** Zircle works pretty well on mobile devices and big screens 

## Dependencies
Zircle is a Vue plugin. For this reason, it is recommendable to have some idea of how Vue works. You can try Vue and learn it in [vuejs.org](https://vuejs.org)

::: tip Information for Vue users
Zircle UI follows the progressive philosophy of Vue. This implies that for small apps or prototyping you can use Zircle directly into the browser and for more complex apps you can use it with Single Page Applications. For this reason, Zircle works with or without Vue-Router.
