# Introduction

## What is zircle ui?

**Zircle ui** is a frontend library to develop [zoomable user interfaces (ZUI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zooming_user_interface). It works with vue.js as a plugin and comes with a set of built-in componentes, such as: buttons, knobs, sliders, scroll bars, dialogs, view controllers and item lists.

- **Zero-conf routes** Using Vue-router? Let zircle handle the routes for you.

- **Customizable themes** Aren't the built-in color themes enough? No problem it is easy to create a new one.

## When to use zircle ui?

You can try zircle ui to develop a wide range of applications, such as: dashboards, health/fitness trackers, IOT hubs or controllers, contact managers, information and entertainment, interactive menus, etc.

In general, using zircle ui should be fine if your application is highly interactive and you need to intuitively view and control information without draw the user’s attention. 

## About zircle ui
Zircle ui is the first [Open Source Project](https://opensource.guide/starting-a-project/) I made and it was possible thanks to the open source community, specially the [Vue](https://vuejs.org) community. In retribution, I tried to make the most high quality project I could within my limitations since I'm not a professional developer. 

Zircle ui intends to be a different aproach in the universe of UIs. The main underlying assumption is that perhaps there is room for a new UI/UX not constrained to grid layouts or to squared shapes. 

Zircle ui was inspired on the idea behind of some really awesome projects and ideas like [prezi](https://www.prezi.com), [impress.js](https://github.com/impress/impress.js), [tizen](https://www.tizen.org/), [zoomooz](http://jaukia.github.io/zoomooz/), [creativebloq's article](https://www.creativebloq.com/create-zoomable-user-interface-css-transforms-9114269), [google maps](http://maps.google.com), [bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), [UIKit](https://getuikit.com/) and [bulma](https://bulma.io) among others.
