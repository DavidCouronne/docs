# Introduction

In this tutorial, we are going to create a **simple dashboard for a smart home app**. By the end, you should have a basic understanding of **zircle ui**. Have in mind that the dashboard is designed just for learning purposes and is not meant to be ready for production.

Some previous knowledge of [**vue.js**](https://vuejs.org) is recommended for this tutorial.
