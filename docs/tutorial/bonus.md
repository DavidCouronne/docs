# Introduction
Here we offer you additional views you can add to our **smart home app**. At this stage you should easily understand what the code does and for this reason little explanation is provided. 

However, if you find out that something isn't clear enough please file an issue or submit a pull request [on GitHub](https://github.com/zircleUI/tutorial). You can also speed up the PR by clicking in **'Edit this page'** that is available at the botton of the pages.
