# Building up your app

In your terminal simple run:

```
npm run build
```

## Previewing Locally
The dist directory is meant to be served by an HTTP server, so it will not work if you open dist/index.html directly over file:// protocol. The easiest way to preview your production build locally is using a Node.js static file server, for example serve:

```
npm install -g serve

serve dist
```




Thank you very much!
